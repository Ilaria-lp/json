# json
A script to extract the XRF spectrum from a json file created from the 64-element detector used at the XAFS beamline at Elettra.
To use it, simply move the .py file inside the folder with the json files and run it. It will automatically look for json files and create a txt file containting the total XRF spectrum (1st column) and the single-element XRF spectra (following columns).
